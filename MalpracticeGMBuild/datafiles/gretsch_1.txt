Gretsch: Hey doc, how's business today?
Gretsch: A friend of mine comes here now. Maybe you've seen her? She's studying for entrance exams now.
Gretsch: Every time we go over chem homework, I remember when I worked here. Not that I want to come back or anything.
Gretsch: In fact the only reason I'm here today is to get something for my *symptom
Gretsch: Can you get anything for me?
